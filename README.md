# Project Title : AdventureWorks Power BI Project

# Project Description

This is my first Power BI project. I analyzed Adventure Works sales data to create interactive dashboards, helping the company understand sales trends, product performance, and customer behavior.

# Dataset

The project uses AdventureWorks_Sales_Data.csv containing sales, products, and order information.

# Tools Used
- Excel
- Microsoft Power BI Desktop
- Git & GitHub
- VS Code

# Key Insights
- **Top-selling products** are in the Mountain Bikes category  
- **Order trends** show which product sizes and categories are performing best  
- Visualizations allow **interactive filtering** by Product Category and Payment Method 

# Notes
- This is my **first Power BI project**, focused on learning the complete workflow:  
  **Import → Prepare → Visualize → Analyze → Communicate insights**.  
- Screenshots are included to showcase the dashboard without opening Power BI.
